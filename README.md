# example-projects-love
A few old projects made for the LÖVE2D framework.

These will require an installation of the [LÖVE2D](https://love2d.org/) framework to run, located at `C://LOVE`.

There are various batch files in each project, which were used as a simple build toolkit.
In general, `compile.bat` packs the code (using 7-Zip) into a `*.love` file, and `run.bat` runs the file.

The batch files may not all be consistent with the expected path of Love2D and 7-Zip; the process is easy to glean from the scripts, so fixes should be easy if there is an issue.

#### Civilization
